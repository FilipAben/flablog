This is the place where I collect my random thoughts, investigations & curiosities for (hopefully) your enjoyment. My main interests, slightly craning their necks in the ocean of side-interests, are tech and running.

I'm currently employed at [ExtraHorizon](https://www.extrahorizon.com), a scale-up in the medical space. We're trying to make it easier for companies to create medical applications while strictly complying to government regulation. In the past, I've worked at a couple of companies, in the telecommunications & energy sector . You can find my resume [here](cv-en.pdf)
