This is the place where I collect my random thoughts, investigations & curiosities for (hopefully) your enjoyment. I'm a father, tech-enthousiast and a runner, in that order.

I'm currently employed at [ExtraHorizon](https://www.extrahorizon.com), a scale-up in the medical space. We're trying to make it easy for companies to create medical applications while strictly complying to government regulation. Through the course of my career, I've worked at a couple of companies. You can find my resume [here](cv-en.pdf)
