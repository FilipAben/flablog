I've been trying to develop a app on and off for the couple of months. Nothing serious, just an hour here and there. It hasn't been exactly smooth sailing so far, mostly due to:
* Actually using XCode for the first time.
* Learning Swift
* Learning SwiftUI and learning the ropes of iOS app development in general. 
* Me generally being far too impatient

Doing this for the first time, there are a couple of things which quickly annoyed me. And frankly, at various points they made me want to reconsider developing in Swift(UI) at all, second guessing whether I should have 'Fluttered' away (har har).

In some ways it's the death-by-a-thousand-cuts scenario and it could have been avoided. 

### Tooling

### XCode

Using XCode is the best way to develop an iOS app, period. But it's not my favourite... I've been using vim for most of my career and I really prefer using it. Yes I know there's a vim mode for XCode, but as with all these emulations they behave differently in enough areas to make you want to pull your hair out at times. Other people swear by other emacs, vs code, sublimetext, bbedit,...and that's all fine with me. But trying to develop SwiftUI apps in any other editor than XCode is prohibitively complicated. 

If you compare this to most other languages, they have clearly separated the tooling from the editor experience, which gives people more choice and in my opinion a more enjoyable experience compared to stumbling around in XCode.
