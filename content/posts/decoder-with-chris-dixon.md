Interesting [discussion](https://www.theverge.com/23020727/decoder-chris-dixon-web3-crypto-a16z-vc-silicon-valley-investing-podcast-interview) on Decoder regarding web3. It's good to see a civil, educated discussion about it. I don't buy into much of the hype around it, but the goals & motivations behind it are not misguided for sure. Unfortunately the worst out-washes of blockchain technology are tainting it severely.

I'm afraid it won't play out as they intended it. Corporations will be corporations who will try to increase marketshare and monopolise any interesting technology. Having a massively decentralised database does not prevent the Googles & Amazons of this world to carve out their piece, build something on top of it & monopolise it. Replace 'database' with 'internet' and that's exactly what happened the past 15 years.
