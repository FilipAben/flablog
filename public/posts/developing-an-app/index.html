          <article class="">  
            <p>I&rsquo;m going to develop an app.</p>
<p>Nothing that serious, it&rsquo;s just something that I want to do and see where it goes. It&rsquo;s actually kind of surprising I haven&rsquo;t done it before and honestly I can&rsquo;t find a solid reason for it, other than that I was pre-occupied with other (work-related) things. I guess just the time was right.</p>
<p>The first choice anyone is faced with is: what technology stack am I going to use? And I&rsquo;ll spoil it for you immediately: I&rsquo;ve settled on SwiftUI.</p>
<p>The choice for a native platform wasn&rsquo;t any easy one and even after the decision was made I lost some sleep over it.
My requirements weren&rsquo;t huge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to maintain</li>
<li>Future-proof</li>
<li>iOS only. Doesn&rsquo;t mean the platform must not support other platforms but iOS is the only platform I&rsquo;m focusing on.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m fairly experienced in React, Javascript &amp; HTML. So React Native was the first thing that popped into my head. I knew it would allow me to hit the tracks running, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure it was the <em>right</em> choice, just the obvious one. When provided with the easiest choice and the best choice, I mostly choose the latter.</p>
<p>So I dug in a bit further and indeed there were a couple of aspects which gnawed at me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance implications: it will never be as fast as a native app. Anybody who tells you otherwise, is lying. React Native uses the same API&rsquo;s as a native app, but there&rsquo;s a whole javascript+react engine there as well. Compared to a compiled Swift binary, it&rsquo;s not possible to make it as fast.</li>
<li>Dependency hell: having worked at lot with the npm ecosystem, I have first-hand experience with the downsides of it. The million dependencies, vulnerabilities, package breaking,&hellip; wasn&rsquo;t looking forward to that.</li>
<li>Technology lag: any solution built on top of native technology will lag behind it.</li>
<li>Facebook is not as invested in React Native as it was before as some online <a href="https://onymos.com/whats-the-future-of-react-native-and-why-does-facebook-care/">reports</a> seem to <a href="https://medium.com/4devs/could-facebook-to-abandon-the-react-native-5a7e8ec481a8">indicate</a>. Not that it necessarily needs it as it seems to be <a href="https://www.ideamotive.co/blog/state-of-react-native-development">thriving</a> regardless. But having a major company driving it and being heavily invested in its success definitely helps. Otherwise it is the zillionth community-run project suffering from all the hubris that comes with it.</li>
<li>The overall sentiment that I got out of articles &amp; reddit, is that once the honeymoon period is over it will be a beast to maintain.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the upside, React Native would give me:</p>
<ul>
<li>A head-start during development: note though that I like to learn and I&rsquo;m not pressed for time at all</li>
<li>Hot reloading, fast development</li>
<li>Cross platform support: I&rsquo;m developing an iOS-only app for reasons which will be obvious when it&rsquo;s out there :)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a plethora of web-based alternatives (Cordova, Ionic, PhoneGap et al.) to consider, but I&rsquo;m lumping them together with React Native. People will disagree. I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re the same as React Native, but they are in the same ballpark of technologies and most of the some arguments still apply, if not being worse.</p>
<p>Finally&hellip; Flutter. Unveiled in 2015 and backed by Google, it is a very compelling alternative. Most of the sentiments about it are positive as well. I&rsquo;ve lost sleep over this because it doesn&rsquo;t seem like a decent, albeit fairly new platform.</p>
<p>But in the end I&rsquo;ve settled on a native SwiftUI app because</p>
<ol>
<li>Performance matters to me</li>
<li>I like the app to have a native feel as much as possible. Cross-platform frameworks typically need to keep multiple sides happy, which results in compromises.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s iOS-only</li>
</ol>
<p>There&rsquo;s some negative sentiment regarding SwiftUI vs UIKit circulating the forums. UIKit being the tried-and-true method of developing iOS apps, SwiftUI the newcomer. I interpreted most of the criticism of SwiftUI as it not being finished yet, causing people need to reach back to UIKit often in order to get xyz done. That&rsquo;s fair I guess. I would be more worried if there was a more fundamental, unfixable issue. Apple is clearly committed to SwiftUI so I think it&rsquo;s the better choice in the long run.</p>
