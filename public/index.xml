      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to develop an app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing that serious, it&amp;rsquo;s just something that I want to do and see where it goes. It&amp;rsquo;s actually kind of surprising I haven&amp;rsquo;t done it before and honestly I can&amp;rsquo;t find a solid reason for it, other than that I was pre-occupied with other (work-related) things. I guess just the time was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first choice anyone is faced with is: what technology stack am I going to use? And I&amp;rsquo;ll spoil it for you immediately: I&amp;rsquo;ve settled on SwiftUI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a developer living in Belgium. This is the place where I collect my rants, random thoughts, investigations &amp;amp; curiosities for (maybe.hopefully?) your enjoyment. My main interests, slightly craning their necks in the ocean of side-interests, are tech and running.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently employed at ExtraHorizon, a scale-up in the medical space. We&amp;rsquo;re trying to make it easier for companies to create medical applications while strictly complying to regulation. In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at a couple of companies, in the telecommunications &amp;amp; energy sector .</description>
